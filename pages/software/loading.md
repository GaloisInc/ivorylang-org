# Uploading SMACCMPilot

These instructions assume you've completed the instructions for [building
SMACCMPilot][building], you have a complete [SMACCMPilot flight
platform][hardware].

### Loading via Black Magic Probe (Debugger)

You can load your SMACCMPilot binary onto hardware with the instructions found
on the [Black Magic Probe][blackmagic] page.


### Loading via USB Bootloader

The PX4 Project has written a very nice USB bootloader for the STM32F4 and a
variety of loading utilities for Windows, Mac, and Linux users.

This bootloader is not supported at this time, but we will be integrating it
in the near future.
