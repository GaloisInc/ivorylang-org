# Flight Platforms

## Generic Quadcopter

SMACCMPilot supports any quadcopter platform that uses standard PWM-based
motor controllers. There are many commercial and do-it-yourself options for
the basic flight platform.

You'll need to build your own wiring harness to connect the PX4FMU flight
controller to the rest of the flight electronics. See [these instructions
on the PX4 project wiki][fmu-breakout] for building a wiring harness.

At this time, we only support multicopters with four motors.

### Accessories

You'll need lithium polymer batteries and a battery charger with any of these
quadcopter kits.

*Real talk: lithium polymer batteries are dangerous.* Please be careful when
charging and using lithium polymer batteries. Overcharging, overheating,
impacts, punctures, or shorts can cause the batteries to [ignite][]. We recommend
charging batteries in a [fire retardant bag][firebag], and [safely disposing
of damaged batteries][dispose].
